# ABS Validation with DLAS
I aimed to validate the ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) using AI. For this validation, I utilized DLAS, an improved version of the well-known hill climbing method. 

I built the model based on the slip ratio-friction coefficient formula:
$$\mu=1.2sin[1.65tan^{-1}\lbrace12s-tan^{-1}(6s)\rbrace]$$

The following graph represents the results obtained using this formula:

The resulting model closely matched the ABS system. The friction ratio in the result model remained at approximately 90% of the highest value observed in the graph.
